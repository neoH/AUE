# store component by uvm_pool
this example shows a typical usage of uvm_pool, by binding a component with the specific KEY, you
can setting into a certain handle of the corresponding component, and get it with the specific KEY
anywhere you want.

this example will set a component in the ext_test level, and get it by uvm_pool from a lower level
called ext_env, thus demostrates that we can access a component handle regardlessly with the
hierarchy.
