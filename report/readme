all report features in one environment, cases:

- report_error_max_quit_cnt
case to set a special max_quit_cnt value, and the count increment will be triggered only by ERROR
2 ways to set the max quit count, one is by calling report server's set_max_quit_count(<num>,<ovrd>)
second is by a command option: +UVM_MAX_QUIT_COUNT=<num>,<ovrd>
attention: the ovrd bit will make the max quit count not overridable by next call of
set_max_quit_count, not current call.

- report_warn_max_quit_cnt
case to set a special max_quit_cnt value, and add warning report to be one of the report that will
trigger the increment

pre_proc_report_message, or post_proc_report_message, to custmize the original report message
function
