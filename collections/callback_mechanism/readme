## `uvm_register_cb(T,CB)
# for `uvm_register_cb(T,CB), which declares a static local bit as the result for calling
# uvm_callbacks#(T,CB)::m_register_pair();

## `uvm_do_callbacks(T,CB,METHOD)
# searching all iterators of specified T, and doing cb.METHOD which cb is a handle of CB from
# iterator

## uvm_callback_iter
# it is just a class that calling methods from uvm_callbacks and makes some procedures more easier
